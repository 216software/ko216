Knockout is great.

These are some of the bindings we've added at 216 Software, LLC

Install like this::

    $ bower install --save --production ko216

How to release updates
======================

Instead of using a "version" field in bower.json, you make a new git
tag and push that up to github, and then you re-register your project.

For example, this is how I released the 1.1.0 version::

    $ git tag
    $ git commit -a -m "Copied in some stuff from a junkdrawer.js file.  Does it work?  Are there tests?  Do I even know what it is?"
    $ git tag 1.1.0
    $ git push github 1.1.0



And now, somebody else can do this to grab this stuff::

    bower install ko216==1.1.0


.. vim: set syntax=rst:
